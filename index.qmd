Hello! I am a graduate student at [Yingling Research Group](https://www.mse.ncsu.edu/yingling/) at NC State.
My PhD research focuses on developing novel modeling method for ultra small nanoparticles and applying machine learning
and nanoinformatics to optimize external magnetic field guided self assembly of nanomaterials.
I'm proficient in large scale atomistic simulations and molecular modeling of magnetic and plasmonic nanoparticles.

Thank you for visiting!
